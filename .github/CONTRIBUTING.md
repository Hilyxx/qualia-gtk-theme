# Contributing

If you notice any bugs or issues with the theme or any of the scripts, please open an issue. If you want to fix it yourself, open a pull request. If you notice any design inconsistencies or think something should look different, you can also open an issue or pull request and provide an explanation for why you think it should be changed. I'm open to criticism as long as you are respectful.

If you want to help out with development, start by making sure you are familiar with CSS and Sass. These are the languages that the themes are written in. Knowledge of Meson, Python 3, and Bash will also be useful, as most of the scripts are written in these languages.

If you go to in the 'src' dir, you should see 4 directories. These are submodules, and are separate git repositiories. If you make any contributions to the themes, they will probably be in one of these 4 repositories.

When you are ready to share your contribution, make a fork of the repo on GitHub, push it there, and open a pull request. 

Try to avoid any major design changes, I will be less likely to merge those.
